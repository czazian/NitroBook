The story starts with his retirement, which finally gave him the time and means to pursue matters close to his heart—the plight of the Palestinian people, and the criminalisation of war—before the country’s troubles soon pulled him back into the maelstrom of Malaysian national politics.  Unable to sit idly by as his country plummeted towards disaster, Dr Mahathir found himself in the unique position of opposing the very party he led for 22 years. More astonishing was his victory in Malaysia’s 14th General Election and his return at the age of 92 as the seventh Prime Minister of Malaysia, making him the oldest serving head of government in the world at the time.  This book offers a frank and at times blunt discussion of the difficulties that the Pakatan Harapan Government faced, the challenges of rebuilding national political consensus, the betrayals from within the coalition that ultimately led to the Government’s downfall in March 2020 and to the many unthinkable firsts in Malaysian politics. Whether one agrees with Dr Mahathir or not, it is impossible to deny the impact he has had—and continues to have—on the Malaysian political landscape.

There are currently no such recommendations for brain aging and dementia.  Nutrition was only recently accorded scientific-field status, and eating has been recognized as a valid technique of defending oneself against brain aging and disorders such as Alzheimers. Scientists have gradually come to recognize the important link between the foods we eat and our mental health. This insight has spawned a rapidly rising body of studies indicating that we may be eating our way to dementia.  What has gone unreported until now is the fact that, of all the organs in our bodies, the brain is the one most easily harmed by a poor diet. Everything in the brain, from its architecture to its ability to perform, begs for optimal nutrition. Many of us are ignorant that the only way to fuel the brain is through our nutrition. The meals we eat are broken down into nutrients, absorbed into the bloodstream, and transported to the brain to replenish depleted store, stimulate cellular responses, and, most critically, be incorporated into brain tissue.', N'~/image/book/book33.jpg', N'Food & Drinks')
